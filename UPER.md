<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
*   I understand the words stating the problem
*   I'm asked to show a basic online shop with a cart page
*   I'm using Micro Center's site as a general guide, and I can picture it in my head
*   I can only hope there's enough information, I'm not very experienced with React yet
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
*   First I devise a vector mockup with Adobe XD to have something to work to, using Micro Center's website as a guide
*   Next I initialize the react project with the command and start formatting it
*   I'll try to make it in one file for simplicity and debugging before refactoring the project into multiple files
*   There are many unknowns but I hope to research them all individually online
*   I'll likely be using Material UI for styling
